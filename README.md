[Gist link here](https://gist.github.com/DjMuffinTops/95aecdc07c9cbf4968cfe3037c7fa22a)

Copy and paste this script into a Google Cloud Apps Script project at https://script.google.com


You will need to replace  `CHANNEL_POST_URL` and `CALENDAR_ID` in the script with your [Discord Webhook URL](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) and your Google Calendar's [Calendar ID](https://docs.simplecalendar.io/find-google-calendar-id/) respectively.

Then, you must enabled Calendar API under Services on the left side of the Apps Script Page. Click the + button next to Services and look for Calendar API and enable it. v3 of the Calendar API should work fine.


You Will then need to setup a trigger to run the `postEventsToChannel` function every minute

You should see any events that will start within the next minute posted into an embed into the discord channel your webhook was on
